abstract = {Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propa- gation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a compre- hensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or ma- chine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not es- sential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. Because this book has broad scope, it is impossible to provide a complete list of references, and in particular no attempt has been made to provide accurate historical attribution of ideas. Instead, the aim has been to give references that offer greater detail than is possible here and that hopefully provide entry points into what, in some cases, is a very extensive literature. For this reason, the references are often to more recent textbooks and review articles rather than to original sources. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, including lecture slides as well as the complete set of figures used in the book, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information: http://research.microsoft.com/∼cmbishop/PRML},

abstract = {Location sharing services (LSS) like Foursquare, Gowalla, and Facebook Places support hundreds of millions of user- driven footprints (i.e., “checkins”). Those global-scale foot- prints provide a unique opportunity to study the social and temporal characteristics of how people use these services and to model patterns of human mobility, which are significant factors for the design of future mobile+location-based ser- vices, traffic forecasting, urban planning, as well as epidemi- ological models of disease spread. In this paper, we inves- tigate 22 million checkins across 220,000 users and report a quantitative assessment of human mobility patterns by ana- lyzing the spatial, temporal, social, and textual aspects as- sociated with these footprints. We find that: (i) LSS users follow the “L`evy Flight” mobility pattern and adopt periodic behaviors; (ii) While geographic and economic constraints affect mobility patterns, so does individual social status; and (iii) Content and sentiment-based analysis of posts associated with checkins can provide a rich source of context for better understanding how users engage with these services.},

A glance at the historical perspective on brain metastasis management clearly shows two major shifts which have been made in last two decades. One is the changes of leading treatment modalities from whole-brain radiation therapy to multimodal management focusing on radiosurgery, and the other is changes of the attitude of the treatment from palliative purpose to disease control. The epoch-making change in the understanding of brain metastasis is that brain metastasis is no longer a death sentence as considered in the past.},

The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify cross-cutting themes and recent advances. We also describe some important applications of clustering algorithms such as image segmentation, object recognition, and information retrieval.},

Clustering is being widely used in many application including medical, finance and etc. Clustering may be applied on database using various approaches, based upon distance, density, hierarchy, and partition. The data item which is not relevant to data mining is called noise (e.g. out of bound and etc). Noise is major problem in cluster analysis, which degrades the performance of various clustering techniques in the term of time and space. Our purpose is to study how a particular clustering technique is responsive to the noise in the terms of time. We have used clustering techniques based upon the partitioned or non-hierarchical clustering, which forms the clusters in one step as opposed to several steps. We will introduce noise in the experimental database and the same will be used for clustering algorithm. Then the percentage of noise will be varied and the time required for clustering will be calculated. The observation so obtained will be used for analysis purpose. After that we will compare and analysis the performance of the clustering techniques based on the time required. Then we will conclude which algorithm is more realistic to noise.},

@article{Jain2010,
abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering.},

abstract = {A graph-theoretic paradigm is used to generalize the common measures of categorical clustering in free recall based on the number of observed repetitions. Two graphs are defined: Graph G, which characterizes the a priori structure of the item set defined by a researcher; and Graph R, which characterizes an S's protocol. Two indices of clustering, denoted by Gamma and Omega, are obtained by evaluating the sum of the pair-wise products of the weights on the corresponding edges of the 2 graphs. It is observed that the Gamma statistic is a direct generalization of the commonly used clustering indices and reduces to the number of repetitions whenever G represents a standard categorical decomposition of a stimulus list. The Omega statistic, on the other hand, extracts more information from the protocol graph, R, than does Gamma and incorporates a distance measure based on the number of intervening items in an S's recall sequence.},

abstract = {Twitter, a popular microblogging service, has received much attention recently. An important characteristic of Twitter is its real-time nature. For example, when an earthquake occurs, people make many Twitter posts (tweets) related to the earthquake, which enables detection of earthquake occurrence promptly, simply by observing the tweets. As described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in Twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event. To detect a target event, we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet, the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering, which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive computing. The particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake with high probability (96% of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected) merely by monitoring tweets. Our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users. Notification is delivered much faster than the announcements that are broadcast by the JMA.},

abstract = {The goal of graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into different clusters based on various criteria such as vertex con- nectivity or neighborhood similarity. Graph clustering techniques are very useful for detecting densely connected groups in a large graph. Many existing graph clustering methods mainly focus on the topological structure for clustering, but largely ignore the ver- tex properties which are often heterogenous. In this paper, we pro- pose a novel graph clustering algorithm, SA-Cluster, based on both structural and attribute similarities through a unified distance mea- sure. Our method partitions a large graph associated with attributes into k clusters so that each cluster contains a densely connected subgraph with homogeneous attribute values. An effective method is proposed to automatically learn the degree of contributions of structural similarity and attribute similarity. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that SA-Cluster is converging. Extensive experi- mental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SA-Cluster through comparison with the state-of-the-art graph clustering and summa- rization methods.},

abstract = {There is an explosion of geographic information generated by individuals on the Web. Users provide geotagged photos and tweets, geotag Wikipedia articles, create gazetteer entries, update geographic databases like OpenStreetMap (OSM) and much more. Such user-generated geodata, also called Volunteered Geographic Information, VGI (Goodchild 2007), is becoming an important source for geo-services like map generation, routing, search, spatial analysis and mashups. Different from traditional geodata, VGI often has no distinct classifying attributes or explicit taxonomy. Users are free to create new tagging schemas or add new properties or text. Although some schema checks may exist on the editor level through auto-completion or templates, these checks are not strict and can be ignored by the user. Analyzing the dynamic and heterogeneous schemas of VGI to find common conceptualizations is an important and complex task. For example, Deng et al. (2009) use density based clustering and a document term matrix to find conceptualizations in geotagged Flickr images. Edwardes and Purves (2007) explore the potential to develop a hierarchy of place concepts based on co-occurring characteristic terms in the description of geotagged photos of the British Isles. Extracting and exploring concepts is an important prerequisite to analyze the quality and consistency of a dataset and to evaluate its “fitness for use” (Gervais 2009).},

Because of the close relation between percolation and epidemic spread, the behavior of percolation in such networks gives insight into infectious disease dynamics. A number of authors have studied percolation or epidemics in clustered networks, but the networks often contain preferential contacts in high degree nodes. We introduce a class of random clustered networks and a class of random unclustered networks with the same preferential mixing. Percolation in the clustered networks reduces the component sizes and increases the epidemic threshold compared to the unclustered networks.},

abstract = {Spatial Data Mining is based on correlation of spatial objects in space. Mining frequent pattern from spatial databases systems has always remained a challenge for researchers. In the light of the first law of geography “everything is related to everything else but nearby things is more related than distant things” suggests that values taken from samples of spatial data near to each other tend to be more similar than those taken farther apart. This tendency is termed spatial autocorrelation or spatial dependence. It’s natural that most spatial data are not independent, they have high autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose an enhancement of existing mining algorithm for efficiently mining frequent patterns for spatial objects occurring in space such as a city is located near a river. The frequency of each spatial object in relation to other object tends to determine multiple occurrence of the same object. We further enhance the proposed approach by using a numerical method. This method uses a tree structure based methodology for mining frequent patterns considering the frequency of each object stored at each node of the tree. Experimental results suggest significant improvement in finding valid frequent patterns over existing methods.},

Partitional clustering algorithms have been recognized to be more suitable as opposed to the hierar- chical clustering schemes for processing large datasets. A wide variety of distance functions and similarity measures have been used for clustering, such as squared Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and relative entropy. In this paper, we compare and analyze the effectiveness of these measures in partitional clustering for text docu- ment datasets. Our experiments utilize the standard K- means algorithm and we report results on seven text doc- ument datasets and five distance/similarity measures that have been most commonly used in text clustering.},

abstract = {Clustering partitions a collection of objects into groups called clusters, such that similar objects fall into the same group. Similarity between objects is defined by a distance function satisfying the triangle inequality; this distance function along with the collection of objects describes a distance space. In a distance space, the only operation possible on data objects is the computation of distance between them. All scalable algorithms in the literature assume a special type of distance space, namely a k-dimensional vector space, which allows vector operations on objects. We present two scalable algorithms designed for clustering very large datasets in distance spaces. Our first algorithm BUBBLE is, to our knowledge, the first scalable clustering algorithm for data in a distance space. Our second algorithm BUBBLE-FM improves upon BUBBLE by reducing the number of calls to the distance function, which may be computationally very expensive. Both algorithms make only a single scan over the database while producing high clustering quality. In a detailed experimental evaluation, we study both algorithms in terms of scalability and quality of clustering. We also show results of applying the algorithms to a real life dataset},

We analyze how this information propagated through the Twitter network, with the pur- pose of assessing the reliability of Twitter as an information source under extreme circumstances. Our analysis shows that the propa- gation of tweets that correspond to rumors differs from tweets that spread news because rumors tend to be questioned more than news by the Twitter community.

abstract = {Real-life graphs not only have nodes and edges, but also have events taking place, e.g., product sales in social networks and virus infection in communication networks. Among differ- ent events, some exhibit strong correlation with the network structure, while others do not. Such structural correlation will shed light on viral influence existing in the correspond- ing network. Unfortunately, the traditional association min- ing concept is not applicable in graphs since it only works on homogeneous datasets like transactions and baskets. We propose a novel measure for assessing such structural correlations in heterogeneous graph datasets with events. The measure applies hitting time to aggregate the proximity among nodes that have the same event. In order to calcu- late the correlation scores for many events in a large net- work, we develop a scalable framework, called gScore, using sampling and approximation. By comparing to the situation where events are randomly distributed in the same network, our method is able to discover events that are highly corre- lated with the graph structure. gScore is scalable and was successfully applied to the co-author DBLP network and so- cial networks extracted from TaoBao.com, the largest online shopping network in China, with many interesting discoveries.},

Open- streetmap (OSM), Google Earth, Qype sowie mit geographis- chen Attributen annotierte Nutzerinhalte wie Wikipedia- Artikel, Blogs und Tweets sind einige Beispiele. Die Daten- formate und -modelle sind oft standardisiert (GML, KML) oder es handelt sich um einfache flache Modelle (GeoJSON, OSM-Format, zeilenbasierte Formate). Die Modelle erlauben dabei die freie Definition von Attributen (Metadaten, Sach- daten) in unterschiedlicher M ̈ achtigkeit.

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are a useful tool to explore data structures and have been employed in many disciplines. The focus of this paper is the partitioning clustering problem with a special interest in two recent approaches: kernel and spectral methods. The aim of this paper is to present a survey of kernel and spectral clustering methods, two approaches able to produce nonlinear separating hypersurfaces between clusters. The presented kernel clustering methods are the kernel version of many classical clustering algorithms, e.g., K-means, SOM and neural gas. Spectral clustering arises from concepts in spectral graph theory and the clustering problem is configured as a graph cut problem where an appropriate objective function has to be optimized. An explicit proof of the fact that these two paradigms have the same objective is reported since it has been proven that these two seemingly different approaches have the same mathematical foundation. Besides, fuzzy kernel clustering methods are presented as extensions of kernel K-means clustering algorithm.},

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class iden- tification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large da- tabases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solu- tion to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to dis- cover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an ap- propriate value for it. We performed an experimental evalua- tion of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 bench- mark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clus- ters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR- ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

abstract = {Given the steadily increasing amount of geographic informa- tion on the Web, there is a strong need for suitable methods in exploratory data analysis that can be used to efficiently describe the characteristics of such large-scale, often noisy datasets. Existing methods in spatial data mining focus pri- marily on mining patterns describing spatial proximity rela- tionships such as co-location patterns or spatial associations rules. In this paper, we present a novel approach to describe the spatial characteristics of geographic information sources comprised of instances of geographic features. Using the concept of interaction characteristics of geographic features, similarities in how features are distributed in space can be computed and interesting patterns of similar features in the datasets regarding their geographic semantics (landmark, lo- cal, regional, global) can be determined. For this, we employ clustering techniques of spatial distance statistics. We discuss the properties of our method and detail a comprehensive evaluation using publicly available datasets (Flickr, Twitter, OpenStreeMap). We demonstrate the fea- sibility of identifying groups of geographic features with dis- tinct geographic semantics, which then can be used to select subsets of features for subsequent learning tasks or to com- pare different datasets.},

abstract = {Clustering is one of the most heated topics in data mining research. In traditional clustering algorithms, each feature is treated equally and each one does the same contribution to clustering. As a matter of fact, redundant and unrelated features may disturb the clustering result. This paper proposed a fuzzy feature selection strategy to improve the clustering algorithm. The strategy is based on measuring 'Feature Important Factor' (FIF) to describe the contribution of each feature to the clustering, and makes use of the FIF to get the generalized weight of the contribution of each feature to clustering. In this strategy, the FIF and clustering result are iteratively modified until the result is stable, for the purpose of improving the clustering result. The experiment of K-means algorithm proves that, the strategy of fuzzy feature selection proposed by this paper, can improve the clustering result effectively.},

@article{Dunn1973,
abstract = {Two fuzzy versions of the k-means optimal, least squared error partitioning problem are formulated for finite subsets X of a general inner product space. In both cases, the extremizing solutions are shown to be fixed points of a certain operator T on the class of fuzzy, k-partitions of X, and simple iteration of T provides an algorithm which has the descent property relative to the least squared error criterion function. In the first case, the range of T consists largely of ordinary (i.e. non-fuzzy) partitions of X and the associated iteration scheme is essentially the well known ISODATA process of Ball and Hall. However, in the second case, the range of T consists mainly of fuzzy partitions and the associated algorithm is new; when X consists of k compact well separated (CWS) clusters, Xi , this algorithm generates a limiting partition with membership functions which closely approximate the characteristic functions of the clusters Xi . However, when X is not the union of k CWS clusters, the limiting partition is truly fuzzy in the sense that the values of its component membership functions differ substantially from 0 or 1 over certain regions of X. Thus, unlike ISODATA, the “fuzzy” algorithm signals the presence or absence of CWS clusters in X. Furthermore, the fuzzy algorithm seems significantly less prone to the “cluster-splitting” tendency of ISODATA and may also be less easily diverted to uninteresting locally optimal partitions. Finally, for data sets X consisting of dense CWS clusters embedded in a diffuse background of strays, the structure of X is accurately reflected in the limiting partition generated by the fuzzy algorithm. Mathematical arguments and numerical results are offered in support of the foregoing assertions.},

abstract = {One of fundamental challenges of clustering is how to evaluate results, without auxiliary information. A common approach for evaluation of clustering results is to use validity indexes. Clustering validity approaches can use three criteria: External criteria (evaluate the result with respect to a pre-specified structure), internal criteria (evaluate the result with respect a information intrinsic to the data alone). Consequently, different types of indexes are used to solve different types of problems and indexes selection depends on the kind of available information. That is why in this paper we show a comparison between external and internal indexes. Results obtained in this study indicate that internal indexes are more accurate in group determining in a given clustering structure. Six internal indexes were used in this study: BIC, CH, DB, SIL, NIVA and DUNN and four external indexes (F-measure, NMIMeasure, Entropy, Purity). The clusters that were used were obtained through clustering algorithms K-means and Bissecting-K- means.},

Such a framework supports document clustering, labeling, and search, with re- spect to contextual knowledge contained in the document collection. To realize the framework, we introduce an ap- proach to project documents into a context-feature space. Then, dimensionality reduction is used to extract contextual topics in this context-feature space. The topics can then be projected back onto the documents.

abstract = {We argue that social networks differ from most other types of networks, including technological and biological networks, in two important ways. First, they have nontrivial clustering or network transitivity and second, they show positive correlations, also called assortative mixing, between the degrees of adjacent vertices. Social networks are often divided into groups or communities, and it has recently been suggested that this division could account for the observed clustering. We demonstrate that group structure in networks can also account for degree correlations. We show using a simple model that we should expect assortative mixing in such networks whenever there is variation in the sizes of the groups and that the predicted level of assortative mixing compares well with that observed in real-world networks.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new metric for measuring similarity between spatial probability distributions, i.e., distributions in multidimensional metric spaces. We motivate this metric in clustering cross-modal data represented in independent mani- folds, based on temporal co-occurrences acquired through Hebbian learning. Similarity can be an elusive notion, and we present a formal definition along with its intuitive motivation. Our approach is based upon a novel normalization of the Kan- torovich-Wasserstein distance. We use this to for- mally define a new metric called Similarity dis- tance, which captures our intuitive notion of what similarity means. We also show how to efficiently approximate this measure by computing it over codebook representations of weighted point sets, which are derived through a novel clustering algo- rithm. We examine this metric applied to several common parametric and nonparametric distribu- tions and describe applications in multimodal learning and mathematical clustering.},

abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},
